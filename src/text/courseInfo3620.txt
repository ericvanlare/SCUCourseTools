Plays to be studied represent Shakespeare&apos;s early, middle, and later work; differing traditions and conventions of comedy; and varieties of comic experience, including, in modern critical terms, romantic comedy; dark, or so-called problem comedy; and a late play (classified in the First Folio of 1623 as a comedy, and drawing on the newly developing Renaissance genre of tragicomedy).   We will give particular attention to discussion of the plays complex cultural and historical contexts as well as to the ways in which Shakespearean comedy explores issues of gender. Required writing, attendance at productions, oral reports, and the option of in-class performance work are all done to stimulate close analysis of the text and discussion of important topics.

{14512~3620~Environmental Studies~ENVS 22~Intro to Environmental Studies~This course presents an overview of environmental studies as an interdisciplinary academic field focused on society-nature relationships. It draws from multiple social scientific disciplines, including geography, political economy, and sociology to pose environmental questions, understand the root causes of problems, and analyze potential solutions at local, national, and global scales. After considering several environmental narratives and reviewing the key events, influential scholarly works, social movements, politics, and policy changes that contributed to the rise of different environmentalisms, this course analyzes the social dimensions of several case studies. These cases include climate change, food security, biodiversity loss, industrial pollution, and green innovation. In the third section, learners consider the personal and collective dimensions of social change, environmental citizenship, and governance interrogating the ethics and leadership models of organizations and individuals active in solving environmental problems.~[Civil Engagement]~[Food, Hunger, Poverty Environment, Sustainability, Values in Science & Technology, Vocation]~[]~Course restricted to Theater and English majors and minors only.~4~4~Bacon~,Christopher Manes~TR~10:20-12:00~KNDY 108~0~Winter 2015~Undergraduate~College of Arts and Sciences}

Examining short stories, critical essays, and novels, we will make connections between writing, culture, and the speculative genre.  Some guiding questions will be: How do we read and interpret these speculative texts? What do they tell us about Americas pasts, presents and futures? In what ways do our reading strategies limit or enhance what the texts disclose? What roles do the historical past, personal experiences, and social environments or conditions play in defining who we are? In critical research and web essays as well as writing in the speculative genre form, we will explore these questions as we chart the complex voices, times, places and myths found in our texts.

{15949~3620~Interdisciplinary~IDIS 3799~Managing Transitions~The course is based on critical transitions, formative experiences, and personal conflict that characterize the common challenges MBAs are likely to face as they progress in their careers. One objective is to help students gain a more robust understanding of some of the pitfalls they may encounter as they make transitions within or across organizations. Research demonstrates that career failures are often associated with individual failures to successfully make these transitions. Blending theory and practice sessions will illustrate the lessons learned by others (such as SV executives) that have sometimes stumbled in making what seem to be straightforward transitions. Why are transitions challenging? Typically transitions require learning new skills and strategies for managing people who have different responsibilities, needs, goals and expectations than the individual has led in the past. For example, the role as individual team member vs. managing a team requires a shift in mindset from getting a job done through personal skills and effort to getting work done through others; shifting from a manager to a leader requires a shift in attention from focusing on doing things right to doing the right things. Such transitions often mean letting go of the very things that have made us successful in the past and deriving satisfaction from others accomplishments. Although easy to understand conceptually, this marks a fundamental shift in individuals identities.~[]~[]~[]~(OMIS 3357, 357 OR OMIS 857) AND (FNCE 3452, 3455, 455 OR 854) AND (ACTG 3102, 302 OR 851) AND (MKTG 3552, 551,553 OR  856) AND (ECON 3402, 405 OR 857) AND (MGMT 3502, 503 OR 850) AND (MGMT 3505, 505 OR IDIS 861) AND (MBAMBAMJ OR MBAJDMMJ OR MBAWKENDMJ)~1~1~Levenhagen~,Michael J~F~05:30-07:30~LUCAS 309~12~Winter 2015~Graduate Business~Leavey School of Business}

An examination of brand measurements illuminates the power of metrics and highlight different aspects of branding strategies. A look at past cases of successful and unsuccessful branding bring out variations in approaches to such issues as master brands, sub-brands, and the branding of services. Finally, the impact of branding architectures and creative positioning on brand equity are considered. Uses both management readings and current articles to provide a solid foundation for analysis. A series of cases drawn from both the product and service arenas will enable students to apply this analytical framework to actual situations. Brand equity and its related metrics provide a standard basis in evaluating various strategies for establishing and growing brands.

{16217~3620~Bioengineering~BIOE 263~Appl. of Genome Engr. & Inform~Advances in genome engineering technologies offer versatile solutions to systematic interrogation and alteration of mammalian genome function. Among them, zinc finger transcription  factor nuclease (ZNF), transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) and CRISPR-associated RNA-guided Cas9 endonuclease (CRISPR/Cas9) have become major drivers for innovative applications from basic biology to biotechnology.  This course covers principles and real cases of genome engineering using either ZFN/TALEN or CRISPR/Cas9-based system. Key applications will be discussed in a comparative fashion to better understand the advantages/disadvantages of each system.  In addition, informatics&apos; tools that facilitate the application design, implementation, data analysis will be covered.

{16218~3620~Bioengineering~BIOE 378~Advanced Biomaterials~The objective of this course is to examine the range of new biomaterials potentially applicable to medical and biotechnology devices.  The content will focus on chemistry and fabrication of polymeric biomaterials, surface properties, nano-scale analytical tools, effects of the biological environment and interaction with cells and tissues.  In teams of 2 to 4, students will prepare and orally present a design study for a solution to a medical problem requiring one or more biomaterials, using tissue engineering and regenerative approaches. Students should be familiar with or prepared to learn medical, anatomical and physiological terminology.  Written assignments are an annotated bibliography drawn from research literature on the topic of the design study and an individually-written section of the team&apos;s report.  Material from lectures and student presentations will be covered in short quizzes and final examination.

{16570~3620~Ethnic Studies~ETHN 130~Studies in African Americn Lit~This discussion-oriented course focuses on readings and writings pertaining to the black fantasticspeculative fiction and films that embrace the supernatural and otherworldly while remaining rooted to some kind of black realism/life. Examining short stories, critical essays, and novels, we will make connections between writing, culture, and the speculative genre.  Some guiding questions will be: How do we read and interpret these speculative texts? What do they tell us about Americas pasts, presents and futures? In what ways do our reading strategies limit or enhance what the texts disclose? What roles do the historical past, personal experiences, and social environments or conditions play in defining who we are? In critical research and web essays as well as writing in the speculative genre form, we will explore these questions as we chart the complex voices, times, places and myths found in our texts.
