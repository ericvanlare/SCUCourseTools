It draws from multiple social scientific disciplines, including geography, political economy, and sociology to pose environmental questions, understand the root causes of problems, and analyze potential solutions at local, national, and global scales. After considering several environmental narratives and reviewing the key events, influential scholarly works, social movements, politics, and policy changes that contributed to the rise of different environmentalisms, this course analyzes the social dimensions of several case studies. These cases include climate change, food security, biodiversity loss, industrial pollution, and green innovation. In the third section, learners consider the personal and collective dimensions of social change, environmental citizenship, and governance interrogating the ethics and leadership models of organizations and individuals active in solving environmental problems.~[Civil Engagement]~[Food, Hunger, Poverty Environment, Sustainability, Values in Science & Technology, Vocation]~[]~Course restricted to Engineering Juniors and Seniors only~4~4~Graham~,Franklin Charles~TR~08:30-10:10~KNDY 109~2~Winter 2016~Undergraduate~College of Arts and Science}

{32625~3720~Interdisciplinary~IDIS 3799~Managing Transitions~The course is based on critical transitions, formative experiences, and personal conflict that characterize the common challenges MBAs are likely to face as they progress in their careers. One objective is to help students gain a more robust understanding of some of the pitfalls they may encounter as they make transitions within or across organizations. Research demonstrates that career failures are often associated with individual failures to successfully make these transitions. Blending theory and practice sessions will illustrate the lessons learned by others (such as SV executives) that have sometimes stumbled in making what seem to be straightforward transitions. Why are transitions challenging? Typically transitions require learning new skills and strategies for managing people who have different responsibilities, needs, goals and expectations than the individual has led in the past. For example, the role as individual team member vs. managing a team requires a shift in mindset from getting a job done through personal skills and effort to getting work done through others; shifting from a manager to a leader requires a shift in attention from focusing on doing things right to doing the right things. Such transitions often mean letting go of the very things that have made us successful in the past and deriving satisfaction from others accomplishments. Although easy to understand conceptually, this marks a fundamental shift in individuals identities.~[]~[]~[]~OMIS 3357, 357 OR 857)&(FNCE 451 OR 2452 OR 3452 OR 854)&(ACTG 3102, 302 OR 851)&(MKTG 3552, 551,553 OR 856)&(ECON 3402, 405 OR 857)& (MGMT 3502, 503 OR 850)&(MGMT 3505, 505 OR IDIS 861)&(MBAMBAMJ OR MBAJDMMJ OR MBAWKENDMJ)&MGMT 3519 PRE-REQ OR CO-REQ~1~1~Cannon~,Maria Baron~S~08:30-03:00~LUCAS 308~3~Winter 2016~Graduate Business~Leavey School of Busines}
