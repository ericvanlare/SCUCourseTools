{26842~3700~English~ENGL 71~Fiction Writing~We will explore the concept of Narratology from both formal and informal approaches. Focusing on the elements of fiction, we will consider the universal human desire to tell, listen to, and read stories. We will also practice the craft of writing fiction towards the goal of sharing, and publishing, our own unique perspectives. We will write/revise, discuss, &amp; in a group setting critique our stories that will be submitted for publication to literary journals (CALO1). We will look in-depth into the short stories of writers from a multitude of backgrounds, connecting the diversity of human experience to our own in an exploration of the universality of existence (CALO2). We will interpret/critique and learn the technique of Deconstruction to better understand the structure of the short story written by canonical practitioners of the craft to better grasp the world in all of its intricacy and to inform our own writing (CALO3). In reading, engaging with, and comprehending the work of published writers and by participating in the act of writing as a response to the issues raised, our focus on the drama of the human experience will not only advance our ability to communicate in writing, it will heighten our ability to grasp our sense of the self and its relation to the greater world.~[Arts]~[]~[]~Course restricted to Senior English majors~4~4~TBA~,Stephen B~MWF~03:30-04:35~OCONR 206~21~Fall 2015~Undergraduate~College of Arts and Sciences}

{26925~3700~Environmental Studies~ENVS 122~Environmental Politics &Policy~This course will engage environmental politics, policy, and governance in the last half century.  Learners will deepen their familiarity with the comparative method and sharpen their ability to critically evaluate a study&apos;s main argument and evidence as we discuss the social and institutional dimensions of environmental change. Part one reviews major environmental legislation in the US, including the National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act, Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, and policy responses to global warming. In part two, learners step back to interrogate the political ecology, science, and struggles over meaning and representation that underpin the politics of environmental policy change. The final section examines the rise of global environmental governance highlighting the roles of non-profit-organizations, civil societies and corporate firms. A concluding discussion identifies avenues for civic engagement, bottom-up accountability, and environmental citizenship. Learners will gain insight into the policy making processes through simulation games, reading and research, develop tools to assess policy outcomes, and find strategies to identify political opportunities.

{27855~3700~Environmental Studies~ENVS 22~Intro to Environmental Studies~This course presents an overview of environmental studies as an interdisciplinary academic field focused on society-nature relationships. It draws from multiple social scientific disciplines, including geography, political economy, and sociology to pose environmental questions, understand the root causes of problems, and analyze potential solutions at local, national, and global scales. After considering several environmental narratives and reviewing the key events, influential scholarly works, social movements, politics, and policy changes that contributed to the rise of different environmentalisms, this course analyzes the social dimensions of several case studies. These cases include climate change, food security, biodiversity loss, industrial pollution, and green innovation. In the third section, learners consider the personal and collective dimensions of social change, environmental citizenship, and governance interrogating the ethics and leadership models of organizations and individuals active in solving environmental problems.~[Civil Engagement]~[Food, Hunger, Poverty Environment, Sustainability, Values in Science & Technology, Vocation]~[]~(UBUSN Major/2nd Major OR Retail Studies Minor OR MATH Major)~4~4~Bacon~,Christopher Manes~TR~10:20-12:00~KNDY 108~14~Fall 2015~Undergraduate~College of Arts and Sciences}

{27869~3700~History~HIST 112~Haitian Revolution~Between 1789 and 1804 the French Caribbean colony of Saint Domingue was the site of the most profound and violent realization of the revolutionary spirit sweeping the Atlantic in the age of democratic revolutions.  This era is usually associated with the French and American revolutions, both key events in the history of democracy and the rhetorical development of human rights as an agenda in the west. However, both stopped short of the most radical realization of the promises of the age of Enlightenment, particularly with regard to slavery and the racial discrimination that went along with it. The slave revolt on Saint Domingue and the Haitian Revolution, by contrast, witnessed the fullest realization of these promises in the form of the only successful slave revolt in human history. The events on Hispaniola took place at the nexus of world historical forces of globalization through commerce, cross-cultural encounter, racial mixing and the dispersal of radical Enlightenment ideas and their realization in the form of revolution.  As a result of the powerful currents of human history that flowed through the region, the Haitian revolution has proved an enduring source of both fear and creativity in the history of race relations, slavery and abolition, and the forging of a new world identity for the descendants of the once enslaved populations of the island.  This course will examine the history of the revolutionary years in Haiti, their near erasure in western historical memory, and the literary and historical recovery of its importance in the twentieth and twenty first centuries.~[C&I 3]~[Democracy, Human Rights]~[C&I 3]~(AMTH 106 AND MATH 22)  AND (COEN 44 OR COEN 45)~5~5~Andrews~,Naomi J~TR~02:00-03:40~OCONR 106~27~Fall 2015~Undergraduate~College of Arts and Sciences}
