This course will provide a survey of African American literary texts from the 18th century through the present, from the poetry and slave narratives of Phyllis Wheatley, Harriet Jacobs, and Frederick Douglass to Nella Larsens Passing, and Stews recent musical, Passing Strange. Instead of moving through the course in a strict chronological fashion, we will progress through an examination of some important themes and motifs of African American literature. We will begin by discussing efforts throughout history to write the African American self into existence. We will next consider the intersections of gender and race and how they may frame an articulation of personhood. Finally, we will interrogate the ways that racial passing and racial performance may constitute forms of public and private protest. We will position African American literature within American literary history to investigate the ways that the political realm influences art, and art influences the political. Similarly, by bringing the past into conversation with the present we can evaluate the continued relevance of historical texts and written experiences on our contemporary moment.

{46587~3820~Environ Studies & Sciences~ENVS 22~Intro to Environmental Studies~This course presents an overview of environmental studies as an interdisciplinary academic field focused on society-nature relationships. It draws from multiple social scientific disciplines, including geography, political economy, and sociology to pose environmental questions, understand the root causes of problems, and analyze potential solutions at local, national, and global scales. After considering several environmental narratives and reviewing the key events, influential scholarly works, social movements, politics, and policy changes that contributed to the rise of different environmentalisms, this course analyzes the social dimensions of several case studies. These cases include climate change, food security, biodiversity loss, industrial pollution, and green innovation. In the third section, learners consider the personal and collective dimensions of social change, environmental citizenship, and governance interrogating the ethics and leadership models of organizations and individuals active in solving environmental problems.~[Civil Engagement]~[Food, Hunger, Poverty Environment, Sustainability, Values in Science & Technology, Vocation]~[]~SENIOR STATUS AND (BSENVSCIMJ OR BXENVSCIMJ OR BSENVSCIMJ OR BXENVSCIMJ) AND ENVS 222 AND ENVS 23 AND (ENVS 110 OR ENVS 115 OR ENVS 116)~4~4~Grudin~,Theodore Robert~TR~10:20-12:00~ALAM 102~38~Winter 2017~Undergraduate~College of Arts and Sciences}

Environmental injustice occurs when environmental benefits and burdens are unevenly distributed along the lines of identity, including race, class, and/or nationality. Food justice research addresses inequalities in food access and studies the patterns, causes, and solutions associated with  increasing hunger and obesity among eaters and the accumulation of environmental costs in agricultural landscapes.

{47644~3820~Scripture & Tradition~SCTR 48~Racializing Jesus~What if Jesus were black, non-white Latino/a, Amerindian, or Asian? Traditionally, contemporary scholars and thelogians have reconstructed the figure of Jesus as a prophet, as a sage, or as a revolutionary of sorts. However, these portraits not only reflect the social location an racial biases of Western scholars, but also address his Jewishness primarily in religious terms. Such reconstructions also seem to feed the popular portrait of Jesus in film and art as a white, blonde, blue-eyed, upper middle class, protestant male. In order to problematize those dynamics and to develop a more pluralistic, ethnically diverse, and political understanding of Jesus, this course seeks to &quot;racialize&quot; the figure of Jesus. Using critical race theory, postcolonial theory, and borderlands theory as well as the tools of traditional biblical scholarship, this course equips students to:  (1) situate the life and ministry of Jesus in its Jewish contexts; (2) explore Jesus&apos;s Jewishness in terms of race and ethnicity; (3) critically engage sources from the New Testament, Apocryphal narratives, Rabbinic literature, and the Quran; and (4) interrogate the racial/racist reconstructions of Western biblical scholarship and popular culture. FInally, the course will help students to map the implications of such a task for interreligious dialogue as well  as for their own faiths, religious traditions, and/or spirituality.

{47753~3820~Interdisciplinary~IDIS 3799~Managing Transitions~The course is based on critical transitions, formative experiences, and personal conflict that characterize the common challenges MBAs are likely to face as they progress in their careers.

Research demonstrates that career failures are often associated with individual failures to successfully make these transitions. Blending theory and practice sessions will illustrate the lessons learned by others (such as SV executives) that have sometimes stumbled in making what seem to be straightforward transitions. Why are transitions challenging? Typically transitions require learning new skills and strategies for managing people who have different responsibilities, needs, goals and expectations than the individual has led in the past. For example, the role as individual team member vs. managing a team requires a shift in mindset from getting a job done through personal skills and effort to getting work done through others; shifting from a manager to a leader requires a shift in attention from focusing on doing things right to doing the right things. Such transitions often mean letting go of the very things that have made us successful in the past and deriving satisfaction from others accomplishments.

{47762~3820~Management~MGMT 3519~Strategic Analysis~This course focuses on the processes by which managers position their businesses to develop and sustain an advantage relative to rivals in the face of uncertainty, rapid change, and competition. Strategy involves understanding the utility of different choices and tradeoffs  choosing what not to do is as important as choosing what to do. As a result, the course covers a variety a tools, frameworks, theories and concepts for analyzing a firms strategic position and the environment in which it is operating. By focusing on the factors that make some strategic positions strong and viable, students will develop the ability to evaluate the effects of changes in resources &amp; capabilities, industry forces, macroenvironmental forces, and technology on industry structure and firm behavior and, in turn, on a firms opportunities for establishing and sustaining a superior position relative to rivals. The course also requires that students integrate and extend the knowledge and skills they have developed throughout their MBA program course work (i.e. marketing, finance, economics, organizational behavior, ethics, information systems, accounting, etc.) into a &quot;total business perspective. Analyzing real world situations best facilitates this activity; therefore, case analysis plays a large role in the course. Students will develop skills in developing a coherent, social responsible, viable and defensible strategic position that will carry a firm into the future.~[]~[]~[]~OMIS 3357, 357 OR 857)&(FNCE 451 OR 2452 OR 3452 OR 854)&(ACTG 3102, 302 OR 851)&(MKTG 3552, 551,553 OR 856)&(ECON 3402, 405 OR 857)& (MGMT 3502, 503 OR 850)&(MGMT 3505, 505 OR IDIS 861)&(MBAMBAMJ OR MBAJDMMJ OR MBAWKENDMJ)&MGMT 3519 PRE-REQ OR CO-REQ~4~4~Madsen~,Tammy~TR~05:45-07:10~~1~Winter 2017~Graduate Business~Leavey School of Business}

{47765~3820~Management~MGMT 3716~Crowdsourcing~Firms are rapidly adopting internet-based collaboration technologies (CT) to involve a wide range of participants in joint product innovation or co-innovation.  Broadly defined, these technologies include software tools and applications that leverage social activity within an online platform to facilitate interaction and collaboration among members of an online community and between members of a community and a firm. As such, they help firms engage the creativity and problem solving skills of firm-hosted online communities of users, employees, and other experts in the creation, development and refinement of products or services. As a result, their use may yield innovations that strongly fit user preferences while also, accelerating the pace and lowering the cost of product innovation. Despite the rapid adoption, many firms struggle with how to create value from CT-based co-innovation. Building on literature on user innovation, open innovation, and demand side value creation, this course explores the conditions for creating value when engaging online communities in co-innovation.
