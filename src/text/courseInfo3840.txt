Four weeks of the course will involve reading and discussing scholarship about the Court-e.g., the certiorari process, the selection of Justices, and how the Court decides cases. Ten weeks of the course will be devoted to the oral argument and decision of cases on the Court&apos;s current docket. At each such class meeting, some students will act as attorneys in the case and present oral arguments. The remaining students will act as justices, questioning the attorneys during argument and then meeting in conference to decide the case. For each case, at least two students will write opinions, which will subsequently be circulated to the entire class for discussion. By the end of the semester, each student will argue at least one case and write two opinions. For these ten class meetings, every student will be required to read the actual briefs that have been filed with the Supreme Court, as well as some of the important precedent cases. Consequently, this course requires more reading than the average law school class. In addition, students&apos; written opinions will be reviewed and discussed by their peers. Students uncomfortable with either of these aspects of the class should consider other courses. Grading will be based on-in order of importance-students&apos; written opinions, their oral arguments, and their general class participation.~[]~[]~[]~LAW 200~3~3~Steinman~,Edward H~W~02:00-04:45~BANN 333~0~Spring 2017~Law~School of Law}

{50662~3840~History~HIST 178~Race and World War II~World War II stands as one of the most explosive moments in U.S. and global history in the 20th century because of the myriad ways the conflict influenced the post-war world. The United States emerged from the war as the premiere global superpower in terms of combined military, diplomatic, and financial supremacy. However, the United States found itself under increased scrutiny due to its history and maintenance of structural or institutionalized racism. In the midst of military and ideological conflict against the Nazi regime in Germany, and addressing the claims of civil rights and anti-colonial activists, the United States became a composite site of the tensions that defined a democratic society struggling with ongoing racism. This reading seminar explores these tensions, which were exacerbated by the rise of anti-racist perspectives in the anthropological and biological sciences just preceding the war. The assigned readings and discussions engage these phenomena in order to properly explore the significance of race in the World War II era.

{50664~3840~History~HIST 131~Britain & the First World War~The First World War gave birth to a range of difficult questions regarding the relationship between democratic ideals and how societies organize for modern conflicts, setting a strong pattern for the 20th Century and continuing to possess strong resonances for today. What strains and opportunities does war place upon democratic societies? Does modern patriotism enable or distort the aspirations of free societies? What forces propel individuals to assist or resist modern warmaking? This course encourages students to think of war as not an activity solely directed by generals and politicians, but rather a social and cultural event that is formed and negotiated by citizens, workers, and parents. This course places the WWI battlefront in the context of British imperial history, and especially examines how four years of fighting shaped Britons  modern national and civic identity. Readings and materials cover the significance of the homefront in many forms, including: the propaganda machine, the Irish problem, public school tradition, industrial organization and trades union activity, and the women&apos;s vote campaign. Civic groups organized by peace protesters, conscientious objectors, suffragists, and striking workers will be explored alongside groups such as national service advocates, Empire leagues, Boys Scouts, and civil preparedness organizations.~[Civil Engagement]~[Democracy]~[]~Course restricted to Hist majors & minors~5~5~Newsom Kerr~,Matthew L.~TR~10:20-12:00~OCONR 106~30~Spring 2017~Undergraduate~College of Arts and Sciences}

{51226~3840~Sociology~SOCI 162~Gender and Justice~This course uses an intersectional approach to examine how gender shapes people&apos;s experiences with crime and with the criminal justice system.Gender inequality impacts how people participate in and are victimized by crime, but it also directs how the state attempts to control crime.Here we can see how crime and the law interact with dominant understandings of masculinity and femininity;while much criminal activity is structured and even normalized by patriarchal relationships between men and women, institutional responses to crime are themselves determined by - and oftentimes reinforce - classed and racialized ideas about who men and women are or ought to be.This class therefore focuses on exploring girls&apos; and women&apos;s experiences with crime and the justice system by situating them within systems of patriarchy, structural racism, and class inequality.

{51886~3840~History~HIST 122~The Holocaust~This course examines the persecution and mass murder of Jews in Nazi Germany and in Nazi-occupied Europe from 1933-1945.  Although the mass murder of European Jewry will be a main focus, we will also discuss programs of discrimination, violence, and murder carried out against other groups deemed racially undesirable by the Nazis (e.g. people with mental and physical disabilities, the Romany, Slavic peoples).  The course starts off contextualizing the Holocaust by looking at how modernity, imperialism, war, and various ideologies, such as Anti-Semitism, nationalism, and scientific racism, shaped policies of discrimination and exclusion in Germany and elsewhere in Europe, and contributed to the rise of Hitler and a ?racial state? in Nazi Germany. We will investigate the marginalization and persecution of Jews and other ?Others? in Nazi Germany and Nazi-occupied Europe, considering differences and similarities in treatment in France, Amsterdam, Germany, Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, and the Soviet Union. We will examine how this violence was transformed into a systematic program of murder in the Eastern European killing fields (the ?Holocaust by bullets?), in the concentration camps in Germany and elsewhere, and in the six death camps in Poland.  Differences and similarities in the treatment and experiences of diverse groups of victims will also be considered; how did, for example, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, nationality, and religion matter?  The course will focus on the place of the Holocaust not only in German history, but also in Eastern and Western European history, and pay attention to how politics, economics, and ideologies ? in different countries and local contexts ? shaped the unfolding of the Holocaust.  For example, we will look at how anti-Soviet, anti-communist sentiment in Poland, Latvia, and Lithuania contributed to anti-Jewish violence. We will also examine difficult questions about resistance, collaboration, complicity, and guilt among Germans, non-Germans, and Jews as well as the passivity of the international community. We will try to understand how ordinary people become mass murderers, how friends and neighbors turned away or became actively complicit in crimes against their Jewish friends and neighbors, and how some people became ?upstanders? despite considerable pressure to be bystanders or participants.  Finally, we will consider how the memorialization and representation of the Holocaust has shaped popular understandings of it and why it seems so important to us today.  We will also evaluate what can be done to prevent future genocides.~[C&I 3]~[]~[]~Course restricted to Theater and English majors and minors only.~5~5~Randall~,Amy E~TR~12:10-01:50~OCONR 106~30~Spring 2017~Undergraduate~College of Arts and Sciences}

{51950~3840~Pastoral Ministries~PMIN 207~The Theology of Marriage~In our multiculltural and postmodern world, the sacrament of marriage has become a very different reality from its form in traditional culture.  The Catholic tradition has wisely maintained marriage as one of the seven sacraments.  Through marriage, our whole-hearted commitment to another in the sharing of all of life and love, God touches our lives, invites us to give up our egos, to die to self-centeredness,and to become whole persons.  Marriage rescues us from self-estrangement, that part of ourselves that struggles to trust, hope, and to love.  This course will explore marriage from a sociological, psychological, philosophical, and most important, theological and sacramental point of view, demonstrating how the Paschal mystery, even in postmodernity, continues to rescue and sanctify the core of human life by sharing it wholeheartedly and unconditionally with the life of another.~[]~[]~[]~BIOE 22 OR BIOL 24~4~4~Parrella~,Frederick J~R~06:00-09:00~KENNA 111~15~Spring 2017~Graduate Arts & Sciences~College of Arts and Sciences}
