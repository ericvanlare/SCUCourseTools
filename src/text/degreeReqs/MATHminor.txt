Upper Division Courses
A student minoring in mathematics must take three 5-unit upper-division courses in mathematics, but no more than one course from MATH 165 and 166. In place of MATH 165 or 166, a student may select an upper-division computer science course. All upper-division courses must be taken from the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science and cannot include Math 100.
