An academic minor in Electrical Engineering requires eight courses. A student's minor program must include at least two courses that are no used to satisfy any part of the student's major program.:

Three required courses:
The minor program must include the following courses and their associated laboratories:
	ELEN 021, 021L - Introduction to Logic Design
	ELEN 050, 050L - Electric Circuits I
	ELEN 115, 115L - Electronic Circuits I

Two optional courses:
Two courses must be selected from the following four courses:
	ELEN 100, 100L - Electrical Circuits II
	ELEN 104, 104L - Electromagnetics I
	ELEN 110, 110L - Linear Systems
	ELEN 151, 151L - Semiconductor Devices

Three electives:
Three electives must be selected from upper division ELEN courses excluding Co-op and the senior design sequence.

Notes about the relationship to other programs:
Computer Engineering:
	ELEN 21, 50, and 153 are required for the COEN major
	ELEN 115 is an accepted technical elective in COEN
	ELEN 123, 127, and 133 are accepted technical electives in COEN
	ELEN 160 satisfies a university core requirement

Bioengineering:
	ELEN 21 and 50 are required for the BIOE major
	ELEN 115 is an accepted technical elective in BIOE.
	ELEN 116, 130, 152, and 156 are accepted technical electives in BIOE.
	ELEN 160 satisfies a university core requirement

Mechanical Engineering:
	ELEN 50 is required for the MECH major
	ELEN 123 is crosslisted with MECH
	ELEN 160 satisfies a university core requirement
