The Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering features a balanced core program in which each student studies the engineering aspects of software and hardware as well as the mathematical foundations of computation. The computer engineering electives permit students to build on this core with varying emphasis, depending on their interests.
Students must also complete the University Core Curriculum requirements for a Bachelor of Science degree in the engineering school and sufficient electives for a total of 191 units.
