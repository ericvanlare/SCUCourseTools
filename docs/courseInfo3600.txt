We will write/revise, discuss, &amp; in a group setting critique our stories that will be submitted for publication to literary journals (CALO1). We will look in-depth into the short stories of writers from a multitude of backgrounds, connecting the diversity of human experience to our own in an exploration of the universality of existence (CALO2). We will interpret/critique and learn the technique of Deconstruction to better understand the structure of the short story written by canonical practitioners of the craft to better grasp the world in all of its intricacy and to inform our own writing (CALO3). In reading, engaging with, and comprehending the work of published writers and by participating in the act of writing as a response to the issues raised, our focus on the drama of the human experience will not only advance our ability to communicate in writing, it will heighten our ability to grasp our sense of the self and its relation to the greater world.~[Arts]~[]~[]~Course restricted to Senior English majors~4~4~Kobylarz~,Philip J~R~05:40-08:40~OCONR 204~0~Fall 2014~Undergraduate~College of Arts and Sciences}

In part two, learners step back to interrogate the political ecology, science, and struggles over meaning and representation that underpin the politics of environmental policy change. The final section examines the rise of global environmental governance highlighting the roles of non-profit-organizations, civil societies and corporate firms. A concluding discussion identifies avenues for civic engagement, bottom-up accountability, and environmental citizenship. Learners will gain insight into the policy making processes through simulation games, reading and research, develop tools to assess policy outcomes, and find strategies to identify political opportunities.

Environmental justice as a principle affirms the right of all people to healthy livable communities. Environmental injustice occurs when environmental benefits and burdens are unevenly distributed along the lines of identity, including race, class, and/or nationality. Food justice research addresses inequalities in food access and studies the patterns, causes, and solutions associated with  increasing hunger and obesity among eaters and the accumulation of environmental costs in agricultural landscapes. After reviewing several seminal studies in environmental and food justice, this class delves into case studies in California and Central America. Learners will conduct a major research project, participate in team-based collaborations, and engage local communities as part of this course.

No previous knowledge of art history or experience with museums is required. As part of the curriculum, students will learn the necessary skills and information to provide thoughtful and engaging tours. They will be trained in Visual Thinking Strategies (VTS), a touring style that uses questions and interactive conversation to relay information about the objects on display. The program provides a great opportunity for students to gain professional experience working in the arts, to learn to speak comfortably and confidently about art, and to develop and improve public speaking skills. In addition to attending class sessions and completing short assignments, each docent is required to give three public tours as part of the course. Students may enroll for up to two quarters to receive both lower- and upper-division credit.

It also incorporates a large number of Heterogeneous IP (Intellectual Property) cores. A single error may dictate a Fab spin of over a million dollars, and typically costs much more by delaying TTM (Time-To-Market). Therefore, SoC Verification is a major challenge that needs to be mastered by design engineers. This course presents various state-of-the-art verification techniques used to ensure thorough testing of the SoC design. Both Logical and Physical verification techniques will be covered.

{12341~3600~Interdisciplinary~IDIS 3799~Managing Transitions~The course is based on critical transitions, formative experiences, and personal conflict that characterize the common challenges MBAs are likely to face as they progress in their careers. One objective is to help students gain a more robust understanding of some of the pitfalls they may encounter as they make transitions within or across organizations. Research demonstrates that career failures are often associated with individual failures to successfully make these transitions. Blending theory and practice sessions will illustrate the lessons learned by others (such as SV executives) that have sometimes stumbled in making what seem to be straightforward transitions. Why are transitions challenging? Typically transitions require learning new skills and strategies for managing people who have different responsibilities, needs, goals and expectations than the individual has led in the past. For example, the role as individual team member vs. managing a team requires a shift in mindset from getting a job done through personal skills and effort to getting work done through others; shifting from a manager to a leader requires a shift in attention from focusing on doing things right to doing the right things. Such transitions often mean letting go of the very things that have made us successful in the past and deriving satisfaction from others accomplishments. Although easy to understand conceptually, this marks a fundamental shift in individuals identities.~[]~[]~[]~(OMIS 3357, 357 OR OMIS 857) AND (FNCE 3452, 3455, 455 OR 854) AND (ACTG 3102, 302 OR 851) AND (MKTG 3552, 551,553 OR  856) AND (ECON 3402, 405 OR 857) AND (MGMT 3502, 503 OR 850) AND (MGMT 3505, 505 OR IDIS 861) AND (MBAMBAMJ OR MBAJDMMJ OR MBAWKENDMJ)~1~1~Levenhagen~,Michael J~F~05:30-07:00~LUCAS 306~21~Fall 2014~Graduate Business~Leavey School of Business}

As part of the curriculum, students will learn the necessary skills and information to provide thoughtful and engaging tours. They will be trained in Visual Thinking Strategies (VTS), a touring style that uses questions and interactive conversation to relay information about the objects on display. The program provides a great opportunity for students to gain professional experience working in the arts, to learn to speak comfortably and confidently about art, and to develop and improve public speaking skills. In addition to attending class sessions and completing short assignments, each docent is required to give three public tours as part of the course.
