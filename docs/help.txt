Welcome to SCU Course Tools!

This program is designed to give you several tools to give a much more
functional approach to navigating Course Avail and choosing your courses. Here
are the commands you can use with it:

	help (h):		view this screen
	quit (q):		quit this application
	seatwatch (sw):		open the seats remaining viewer for your watchlist
	search (f):		search for a class by department (-d DEPT) or term (-t Qyy), more coming soon
	add xxxxx yyyyy:	add specified courses to watchlist, can add multiple at a time
	remove xxxxx yyyyy:	remove specified courses from watchlist, can remove multiple at a time
	update Qyy:		update the course database for the specified quarter
	*details xxxxx:		get details on specified course
	*doubledip (dd) Qyy:	get info on double dippable core classes for specified term

	*Not completely functional at the moment
	custom core reqs coming later


And my testing stuff that's on here for now:

	mdd:			get info on double dippable core classes that i still need

That's all for now. Stay tuned for more features!
