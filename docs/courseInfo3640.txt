Students participate directly in the investigative process by interviewing prisoners, witnesses, crime lab personnel, law enforcement, defense attorneys and prosecutors to help prove claims of innocence. Beyond investigating their cases and interviewing witnesses, NCIP students draft legal documents such as motions, declarations, briefs, legal memoranda and letters to attorneys, clients and others. Students also attend and participate in court proceedings. NCIP students must attend an intensive two day training session known as &quot;NCIP Boot Camp&quot; and attend classes twice weekly which focus on post-conviction law and issues relevant to wrongful conviction. Class topics include federal and state habeas corpus procedures, post-conviction DNA testing laws, investigation techniques, witness interview strategies, and the science of DNA testing.

Relationships of individuals to states, global population movements, and formations of communities have all changed recently. When politicians, economists, and academics struggle with theories of global citizenship, they are labeled visionary. When laborers struggle with the realities of global citizenship, they are labeled differently. Both of these groups are trying to answer the question of what it means to be a good citizen.

{18612~3640~English~ENGL 180~Writing for Teachers~English 180 introduces students to writing pedagogy and academic writing practices; the course is primarily designed to support new teachers interested in teaching at any level of education. The course is premised on the idea that all teachers are involved in writing education in one way or another, regardless of specialization area and institutional situation. When we assign or evaluate student writing we are, in essence, writing teachers regardless of our specialization. English 180 can then be divided into three inquiries: 1) where do writing courses come from, historically and conceptually? 2) which goals are we pursuing when we teach writing? 3) what are some of the best ways to think about teaching writing itself? We will study not only scholarly conversations about writing, but writing in action as well. Thus, this course includes an experiential, community-based learning component. I will ask you to learn about writing by observing and interacting with writers in different community locations ranging from a local adult learning center to more traditional local middle and high schools. The course will therefore treat you as writing teachers in training, challenging you to interact with actual writers as they pursue particular goals while also considering how you might simultaneously learn more about how writing works and offer useful feedback to writers wherever you meet them.~[Advanced Writing]~[]~[]~COMM 1 & COMM 2 & at least 88 UNITS (includes units in progress)~5~5~Serviss~,Patricia Colleen~TR~10:20-12:00~OCONR 210~10~Spring 2015~Undergraduate~College of Arts and Sciences}

{18660~3640~Ethnic Studies~ETHN 20~Intro to Chicana&Latina/o Stud~Since 1996 Latinas/os have constituted the largest  (and fastest growing) racial/ethnic minority population in U.S.  Despite the significance of this population, most non-Latinas/os have little knowledge of the history, challenges, and important contributions made by this complex population.  This class will begin to remedy that gap in knowledge by introducing students to the history and contemporary struggles of Chicanas/os  and Latinas/os in the U.S., focusing particular attention on the experiences of the three largest groups of Latinas/os today; namely Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans and Cuban Americans.~[Diversity]~[Race Place & Social Inequities]~[]~JR OR SR STANDING AND (BIOL 23 OR ENVS 21)~4~4~Sampaio~,Anna Christina~TR~02:00-03:40~KENNA 212~20~Spring 2015~Undergraduate~College of Arts and Sciences}

{18666~3640~Ethnic Studies~ETHN 152~Multi-Racial Identities~The term multiracial identity challenges the claim inherent in the traditionally handed down concept that racial categories are mutually exclusive (in that one cannot claim to more than one racial identity even if their heritage comprises of different races) and therefore possess similar qualities or traits.  This course focuses on this dilemma that represents a primary concern of multiracial literature in the United States today. Drawing on theoretical premises laid out by Stuart Hall this class reads Barack Obamas Dreams from My Father, among other texts, as a narrative of the son of biracial parents. During the quarter we define and differentiate the biological given of race, the social construction of race, interracial marriages among other themes seminal to the understanding of multiracial identities.~[Diversity]~[Race Place & Social Inequities]~[]~JR OR SR STANDING AND (BIOL 23 OR ENVS 21)~5~5~Nanda~,Aparajita~TR~02:00-03:40~OCONR 105~0~Spring 2015~Undergraduate~College of Arts and Sciences}

The United States emerged from the war the premiere global superpower in terms of combined military, diplomatic, and financial supremacy but found itself under increased scrutiny due to its history and maintenance of structural or institutionalized racism.  In the midst of military and ideological conflict against the Nazi regime in Germany, and addressing the claims of civil rights and anti-colonial activists, the United States became a composite site of the tensions that defined a democratic society struggling with ongoing racism.

{19889~3640~Management~MGMT 3519~Strategic Analysis~This course focuses on the processes by which managers position their businesses to develop and sustain an advantage relative to rivals in the face of uncertainty, rapid change, and competition. Strategy involves understanding the utility of different choices and tradeoffs  choosing what not to do is as important as choosing what to do. As a result, the course covers a variety a tools, frameworks, theories and concepts for analyzing a firms strategic position and the environment in which it is operating. By focusing on the factors that make some strategic positions strong and viable, students will develop the ability to evaluate the effects of changes in resources &amp; capabilities, industry forces, macroenvironmental forces, and technology on industry structure and firm behavior and, in turn, on a firms opportunities for establishing and sustaining a superior position relative to rivals. The course also requires that students integrate and extend the knowledge and skills they have developed throughout their MBA program course work (i.e. marketing, finance, economics, organizational behavior, ethics, information systems, accounting, etc.) into a &quot;total business perspective. Analyzing real world situations best facilitates this activity; therefore, case analysis plays a large role in the course.

{20130~3640~Interdisciplinary~IDIS 3799~Managing Transitions~The course is based on critical transitions, formative experiences, and personal conflict that characterize the common challenges MBAs are likely to face as they progress in their careers. One objective is to help students gain a more robust understanding of some of the pitfalls they may encounter as they make transitions within or across organizations. Research demonstrates that career failures are often associated with individual failures to successfully make these transitions. Blending theory and practice sessions will illustrate the lessons learned by others (such as SV executives) that have sometimes stumbled in making what seem to be straightforward transitions. Why are transitions challenging? Typically transitions require learning new skills and strategies for managing people who have different responsibilities, needs, goals and expectations than the individual has led in the past. For example, the role as individual team member vs. managing a team requires a shift in mindset from getting a job done through personal skills and effort to getting work done through others; shifting from a manager to a leader requires a shift in attention from focusing on doing things right to doing the right things. Such transitions often mean letting go of the very things that have made us successful in the past and deriving satisfaction from others accomplishments. Although easy to understand conceptually, this marks a fundamental shift in individuals identities.~[]~[]~[]~(OMIS 3357, 357 OR OMIS 857) AND (FNCE 3452, 3455, 455 OR 854) AND (ACTG 3102, 302 OR 851) AND (MKTG 3552, 551,553 OR  856) AND (ECON 3402, 405 OR 857) AND (MGMT 3502, 503 OR 850) AND (MGMT 3505, 505 OR IDIS 861) AND (MBAMBAMJ OR MBAJDMMJ OR MBAWKENDMJ)~1~1~Cannon~,Maria Baron~F~05:30-07:30~LUCAS 309~0~Spring 2015~Graduate Business~Leavey School of Business}

{20388~3640~Interdisciplinary~IDIS 3799~Managing Transitions~The course is based on critical transitions, formative experiences, and personal conflict that characterize the common challenges MBAs are likely to face as they progress in their careers. One objective is to help students gain a more robust understanding of some of the pitfalls they may encounter as they make transitions within or across organizations. Research demonstrates that career failures are often associated with individual failures to successfully make these transitions. Blending theory and practice sessions will illustrate the lessons learned by others (such as SV executives) that have sometimes stumbled in making what seem to be straightforward transitions. Why are transitions challenging? Typically transitions require learning new skills and strategies for managing people who have different responsibilities, needs, goals and expectations than the individual has led in the past. For example, the role as individual team member vs. managing a team requires a shift in mindset from getting a job done through personal skills and effort to getting work done through others; shifting from a manager to a leader requires a shift in attention from focusing on doing things right to doing the right things. Such transitions often mean letting go of the very things that have made us successful in the past and deriving satisfaction from others accomplishments. Although easy to understand conceptually, this marks a fundamental shift in individuals identities.~[]~[]~[]~(OMIS 3357, 357 OR OMIS 857) AND (FNCE 3452, 3455, 455 OR 854) AND (ACTG 3102, 302 OR 851) AND (MKTG 3552, 551,553 OR  856) AND (ECON 3402, 405 OR 857) AND (MGMT 3502, 503 OR 850) AND (MGMT 3505, 505 OR IDIS 861) AND (MBAMBAMJ OR MBAJDMMJ OR MBAWKENDMJ)~1~1~Brock~,Phyllis S~F~05:30-07:30~LUCAS 308~1~Spring 2015~Graduate Business~Leavey School of Business}
