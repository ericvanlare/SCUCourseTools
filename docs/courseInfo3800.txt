{42650~3800~English~ENGL 71~Fiction Writing~We will explore the concept of Narratology from both formal and informal approaches. Focusing on the elements of fiction, we will consider the universal human desire to tell, listen to, and read stories. We will also practice the craft of writing fiction towards the goal of sharing, and publishing, our own unique perspectives. We will write/revise, discuss, &amp; in a group setting critique our stories that will be submitted for publication to literary journals (CALO1). We will look in-depth into the short stories of writers from a multitude of backgrounds, connecting the diversity of human experience to our own in an exploration of the universality of existence (CALO2). We will interpret/critique and learn the technique of Deconstruction to better understand the structure of the short story written by canonical practitioners of the craft to better grasp the world in all of its intricacy and to inform our own writing (CALO3). In reading, engaging with, and comprehending the work of published writers and by participating in the act of writing as a response to the issues raised, our focus on the drama of the human experience will not only advance our ability to communicate in writing, it will heighten our ability to grasp our sense of the self and its relation to the greater world.~[Arts]~[]~[]~Course restricted to Senior English majors~4~4~McIsaac~,Claudia M~MWF~11:45-12:50~OCONR 209~22~Fall 2016~Undergraduate~College of Arts and Science}

{42733~3800~Environmental Studies~ENVS 22~Intro to Environmental Studies~This course presents an overview of environmental studies as an interdisciplinary academic field focused on society-nature relationships. It draws from multiple social scientific disciplines, including geography, political economy, and sociology to pose environmental questions, understand the root causes of problems, and analyze potential solutions at local, national, and global scales. After considering several environmental narratives and reviewing the key events, influential scholarly works, social movements, politics, and policy changes that contributed to the rise of different environmentalisms, this course analyzes the social dimensions of several case studies. These cases include climate change, food security, biodiversity loss, industrial pollution, and green innovation. In the third section, learners consider the personal and collective dimensions of social change, environmental citizenship, and governance interrogating the ethics and leadership models of organizations and individuals active in solving environmental problems.~[Civil Engagement]~[Food, Hunger, Poverty Environment, Sustainability, Values in Science & Technology, Vocation]~[]~SENIOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES OR ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE MAJORS OR SECOND MAJORS~4~4~TBA~,Virginia~TR~08:30-10:10~ALAM 102~40~Fall 2016~Undergraduate~College of Arts and Science}

{42804~3800~Liberal Studies~LBST 100~Research in Social Sciences~Provides an introduction to educational research design as it informs hypothesis testing and theory development. Nurtures students skills at reading and understanding educational research. Though the emphasis will be placed on being a consumer of research rather than a producer, in order to fully understand empirical findings it is essential that one understands the process of scientific inquiry. Surveys quantitative and qualitative research methods, and emphasizes the relationship between a research problem, the exploration of that problem, and the inferences that can be drawn from empirical inquiry. Students will learn how to judge the reliability and critique the validity of research on such things as learning and cognition, curriculum and instruction, child development, reading and literacy, etc., using general social science design principles. Writing for academic audiences is also a course objective.

{43819~3800~Scripture & Tradition~SCTR 19~Religions of the Book~This course offers an introduction to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam with a study of their central texts, traditions and practices. We begin the course with a paradox: religion, that which in its literal sense &quot;binds&quot; or &quot;fastens together,&quot; is also that which often violently divides our world. As we examine the sacred texts of Jews, Christians, and Muslims (Hebrew Bible, New Testament, and Qur&apos;an) and various methods of interpreting them, our focus will remain on what is shared and what characteristically distinguishes between the monotheistic faiths.~[RTC 1]~[Islamic Studies]~[]~BIOL 25 AND ENGL 1A AND ENGL 1B~4~4~TBA~,Teresa~MWF~02:15-03:20~KENNA 102~28~Fall 2016~Undergraduate~College of Arts and Science}
