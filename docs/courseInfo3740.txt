{34175~3740~History~HIST 178~Race and World War II~World War II stands as one of the most explosive moments in U.S. and global history in the 20th century because of the myriad ways the conflict influenced the post-war world. The United States emerged from the war as the premiere global superpower in terms of combined military, diplomatic, and financial supremacy. However, the United States found itself under increased scrutiny due to its history and maintenance of structural or institutionalized racism. In the midst of military and ideological conflict against the Nazi regime in Germany, and addressing the claims of civil rights and anti-colonial activists, the United States became a composite site of the tensions that defined a democratic society struggling with ongoing racism. This reading seminar explores these tensions, which were exacerbated by the rise of anti-racist perspectives in the anthropological and biological sciences just preceding the war. The assigned readings and discussions engage these phenomena in order to properly explore the significance of race in the World War II era.

{34179~3740~History~HIST 131~War & Democracy: UK in WWI~The First World War gave birth to a range of difficult questions regarding the relationship between democratic ideals and how societies organize for modern conflicts, setting a strong pattern for the 20th Century and continuing to possess strong resonances for today. What strains and opportunities does war place upon democratic societies? Does modern patriotism enable or distort the aspirations of free societies? What forces propel individuals to assist or resist modern warmaking? This course encourages students to think of war as not an activity solely directed by generals and politicians, but rather a social and cultural event that is formed and negotiated by citizens, workers, and parents. This course places the WWI battlefront in the context of British imperial history, and especially examines how four years of fighting shaped Britons  modern national and civic identity. Readings and materials cover the significance of the homefront in many forms, including: the propaganda machine, the Irish problem, public school tradition, industrial organization and trades union activity, and the women&apos;s vote campaign. Civic groups organized by peace protesters, conscientious objectors, suffragists, and striking workers will be explored alongside groups such as national service advocates, Empire leagues, Boys Scouts, and civil preparedness organizations.~[Civil Engagement]~[Democracy]~[]~Course restricted to Hist majors & minors~5~5~Newsom Kerr~,Matthew L.~TR~02:00-03:40~OCONR 204~30~Spring 2016~Undergraduate~College of Arts and Science}

{36612~3740~Interdisciplinary~IDIS 3799~Managing Transitions~The course is based on critical transitions, formative experiences, and personal conflict that characterize the common challenges MBAs are likely to face as they progress in their careers. One objective is to help students gain a more robust understanding of some of the pitfalls they may encounter as they make transitions within or across organizations. Research demonstrates that career failures are often associated with individual failures to successfully make these transitions. Blending theory and practice sessions will illustrate the lessons learned by others (such as SV executives) that have sometimes stumbled in making what seem to be straightforward transitions. Why are transitions challenging? Typically transitions require learning new skills and strategies for managing people who have different responsibilities, needs, goals and expectations than the individual has led in the past. For example, the role as individual team member vs. managing a team requires a shift in mindset from getting a job done through personal skills and effort to getting work done through others; shifting from a manager to a leader requires a shift in attention from focusing on doing things right to doing the right things. Such transitions often mean letting go of the very things that have made us successful in the past and deriving satisfaction from others accomplishments. Although easy to understand conceptually, this marks a fundamental shift in individuals identities.~[]~[]~[]~OMIS 3357, 357 OR 857)&(FNCE 451 OR 2452 OR 3452 OR 854)&(ACTG 3102, 302 OR 851)&(MKTG 3552, 551,553 OR 856)&(ECON 3402, 405 OR 857)& (MGMT 3502, 503 OR 850)&(MGMT 3505, 505 OR IDIS 861)&(MBAMBAMJ OR MBAJDMMJ OR MBAWKENDMJ)&MGMT 3519 PRE-REQ OR CO-REQ~1~1~Cannon~,Maria Baron~S~08:30-03:00~LUCAS 306~4~Spring 2016~Graduate Business~Leavey School of Busines}

{36614~3740~Interdisciplinary~IDIS 3799~Managing Transitions~The course is based on critical transitions, formative experiences, and personal conflict that characterize the common challenges MBAs are likely to face as they progress in their careers. One objective is to help students gain a more robust understanding of some of the pitfalls they may encounter as they make transitions within or across organizations. Research demonstrates that career failures are often associated with individual failures to successfully make these transitions. Blending theory and practice sessions will illustrate the lessons learned by others (such as SV executives) that have sometimes stumbled in making what seem to be straightforward transitions. Why are transitions challenging? Typically transitions require learning new skills and strategies for managing people who have different responsibilities, needs, goals and expectations than the individual has led in the past. For example, the role as individual team member vs. managing a team requires a shift in mindset from getting a job done through personal skills and effort to getting work done through others; shifting from a manager to a leader requires a shift in attention from focusing on doing things right to doing the right things. Such transitions often mean letting go of the very things that have made us successful in the past and deriving satisfaction from others accomplishments. Although easy to understand conceptually, this marks a fundamental shift in individuals identities.~[]~[]~[]~OMIS 3357, 357 OR 857)&(FNCE 451 OR 2452 OR 3452 OR 854)&(ACTG 3102, 302 OR 851)&(MKTG 3552, 551,553 OR 856)&(ECON 3402, 405 OR 857)& (MGMT 3502, 503 OR 850)&(MGMT 3505, 505 OR IDIS 861)&(MBAMBAMJ OR MBAJDMMJ OR MBAWKENDMJ)&MGMT 3519 PRE-REQ OR CO-REQ~1~1~Brock~,Phyllis S~S~08:30-03:00~LUCAS 306~5~Spring 2016~Graduate Business~Leavey School of Busines}

Especially in high technology markets, where new purchases are capital investments measured by impact to the business and return on investment, a products value proposition has to be extremely clear, tangible and differentiated in order to achieve vendor preference, as well as maintain desired pricing and margin levels. This two credit-hour course focuses on proven, effective strategies for understanding customer requirements and translating them into clear, digestable and differentiated messaging statements. We will provide strategies and examples to achieve strong competitive positioning, as well as how and when to (re-)define an entire market vs. just differentially position your products. Specific topics will include best practices for positioning and messaging creation, competitive landscape modeling and developing differentiation, translating customer requirements into effective positioning/ messaging, and wholesale market (re-definition).

{36662~3740~Interdisciplinary~IDIS 3799~Managing Transitions~The course is based on critical transitions, formative experiences, and personal conflict that characterize the common challenges MBAs are likely to face as they progress in their careers. One objective is to help students gain a more robust understanding of some of the pitfalls they may encounter as they make transitions within or across organizations. Research demonstrates that career failures are often associated with individual failures to successfully make these transitions. Blending theory and practice sessions will illustrate the lessons learned by others (such as SV executives) that have sometimes stumbled in making what seem to be straightforward transitions. Why are transitions challenging? Typically transitions require learning new skills and strategies for managing people who have different responsibilities, needs, goals and expectations than the individual has led in the past. For example, the role as individual team member vs. managing a team requires a shift in mindset from getting a job done through personal skills and effort to getting work done through others; shifting from a manager to a leader requires a shift in attention from focusing on doing things right to doing the right things. Such transitions often mean letting go of the very things that have made us successful in the past and deriving satisfaction from others accomplishments. Although easy to understand conceptually, this marks a fundamental shift in individuals identities.~[]~[]~[]~OMIS 3357, 357 OR 857)&(FNCE 451 OR 2452 OR 3452 OR 854)&(ACTG 3102, 302 OR 851)&(MKTG 3552, 551,553 OR 856)&(ECON 3402, 405 OR 857)& (MGMT 3502, 503 OR 850)&(MGMT 3505, 505 OR IDIS 861)&(MBAMBAMJ OR MBAJDMMJ OR MBAWKENDMJ)&MGMT 3519 PRE-REQ OR CO-REQ~1~1~Cannon~,Maria Baron~S~03:00-08:30~LUCAS 206~0~Spring 2016~Graduate Business~Leavey School of Busines}
