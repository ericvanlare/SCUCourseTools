# SCUCourseTools

Command line interface to easily plan and keep track of courses you're
interested in registering for.

SCUCourseTools offers course viewing functionality from the command line,
including a seat watcher, a powerful course search, core requirement
planning, and course scheduling.

A little background on this project: Santa Clara has a website called
CourseAvail that lets students view details about classes, among which is
the amount of seats remaining. Back when I made this, it was not the easiest
to use if you wanted to keep track of all the courses you were watching, so
someone came along and made scuclasses.com. This website lets students pick
classes, see how they line up in a schedule, and watch the seats. This is a
great tool for students to use to keep track of classes and schedules, but
it didn't quite suit all of my needs. I wanted something quick and powerful
that I had complete control over, so I made SCUCourseTools.
